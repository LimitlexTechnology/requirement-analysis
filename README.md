# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is created as part of the FeatureForge: Crafting Your Project Blueprint initiative under the ALX Software Engineering Program. It focuses on the **Requirement Analysis phase** of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how requirements are gathered, documented, and validated before actual development begins. It highlights key aspects such as **functional and non-functional requirements**, **use case diagrams**, and **acceptance criteria** for a Booking Management System.

By completing this project, we gain hands-on experience in structuring project requirements, ensuring clear communication between stakeholders and developers, and setting a strong foundation for successful project delivery.



## 🧩 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial stage in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** that involves identifying, gathering, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It ensures that the development team fully understands what the client or end user wants before any design or coding begins.

The process involves close collaboration among
