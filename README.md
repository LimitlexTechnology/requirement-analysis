# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is created as part of the FeatureForge: Crafting Your Project Blueprint initiative under the ALX Software Engineering Program. It focuses on the **Requirement Analysis phase** of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how requirements are gathered, documented, and validated before actual development begins. It highlights key aspects such as **functional and non-functional requirements**, **use case diagrams**, and **acceptance criteria** for a Booking Management System.

By completing this project, we gain hands-on experience in structuring project requirements, ensuring clear communication between stakeholders and developers, and setting a strong foundation for successful project delivery.

Add "What is Requirement Analysis" section
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that focuses on understanding, gathering, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation upon which the entire project is built, ensuring that developers and clients have a clear, shared understanding of the system to be developed.

During this stage, business analysts, project managers, and developers work together to identify what the system should do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements). The process may involve interviews, surveys, workshops, and brainstorming sessions with users and stakeholders to capture both business objectives and user needs.

Requirement Analysis is important because it:

Prevents misunderstandings between developers and clients.

Defines the project’s scope and boundaries, helping avoid scope creep.

Lays the groundwork for design, development, and testing.

Ensures that the final product meets user expectations and business goals.

Saves time and cost by detecting potential issues early in the project.

In short, Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between an idea and a working solution, ensuring that every feature developed aligns with real-world needs and project objectives.
